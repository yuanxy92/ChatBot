# How to use
## Update May-04-2018
Make the code easier to use, just run client.m. You can type exit to exit the matlab code, and the python server will exit, too.

But before using this code, you need to modify the code in two following places:

*run_in_anaconda.bat*: the first line and the third line is used to enable/disable conda virtual environment, aiml is my virtual environment name, replace it with yours. If you do not use python in conda virtual environment, please delete these two lines.

*client.m*: modify the path of your python file in line 7

## What you need
1. Python 2 (aiml only supports 2)
2. Matlab

## Install
1. Install python2 (anaconda recommend)
2. pip install aiml

## How to use
1. Run python chat.py
2. Run client.m in matlab
